### Jan 17 current ideation:
store data as jsons for now for easy schema changes and manipulation i.e. flattening, expanding

frontend will be done in electronJS -> what UI screens do i want them to see? what do i want from the UI?
- large bold text, old man can't see
- intuitive, simple interface, with lots of pop up descriptors/tutorials available if he forgets

first try to set up a way such that electronJS can take in user input and store it correctly into a json
